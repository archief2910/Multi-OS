Multi-OS is a minimal operating system kernel for x86_64 systems by transforming a freestanding binary and integrating it with a BIOS-based bootloader. This project involves designing a custom target tailored for the x86_64 architecture, ensuring compatibility and efficient hardware management. Critical steps include disabling SIMD instructions and the red-zone to prevent stack corruption and simplify the kernel's initial design. By focusing on these key aspects, it successfully initializes hardware through BIOS and provides a robust foundation for a minimal yet functional OS kernel.
